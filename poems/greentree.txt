There’s a green oak-tree by the shores
Of the blue bay; on a gold chain,
The cat, learned in the fable stories,
Walks round the tree in ceaseless strain:
  Moves to the right – a song it groans,
  Moves to the left – it tells a tale.
  There’re marvels there: the wood-spite roams,
  Midst branches shines the mermaids’ tail;
  There are the strangest creatures’ traces
  On the mysterious paths and moors;
  There stands a hut on hen’s legs, hairless,
  Without windows and doors;
  There visions fill a vale and forest;
  There, at a dawn, come waves, the coldest,
  On the deserted sandy shore,
  And thirty knights, in armors shone,
  Come out the clear waves in a colon,
  And their sea-tutor – them before;
  There a brave prince, in a fight, shortest,
  Makes to surrender a king, dread;
  There, to men’ views, a wizard, worthless,
  O’er woods and seas, through clouds, aired,
  Carries a worrier on his beard;
  A princess pines away in prison,
  And a wolf serves her without treason;
  A mortar, with a witch in it,
  Walks as if having somewhat feet;
  There’s King Kashchey, o’er his gold withered;
  There’s Russian odour… Russian spirit!
  And I there sat: I drank sweet mead,
  Saw, near the sea, the green oak, growing,
  Under it heard a cat, much-knowing,
  Talking me its long stories’ set.
  Having recalled one of its stories,
  I’ll recite it to the world, glorious…
